2.0: 01 feb. 1999: Whoah! This version is very smart! It calculates
	 the amount of bars that can be shown on-screen (yess..lovely,
	 huh?) and if there are more bars than can be shown, you can
	 scroll thru the list of bars :) Furthermore, nmixer now
	 auto-detects the mixer-devices that your sound-device supports,
	 without specifying it in the Makefile. *AND* it uses autoconf
	 for smart&easy configuring.

1.2: Left and right bars now represent the left resp. right channel as
     opposed to the previous version (aah..whoops).

1.1: Left and right channels can be set individually using the numeric
     keypad.

1.0: First version that is worth mentioning. Can only set the volume for
     PCM / master-volume and can't set left/right channels individually.
