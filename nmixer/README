This is an interactive mixer for soundcards using ncurses on a normal non-
graphical terminal. It is especially useful for those who want the easy
usage of xmixer but who do not want to start X to use the soundcard's mixer..

The program uses autoconf for smart&easy configuring, and is known to
work on x86/linux and Sparc/NetBSD, but probably works on any BSD-flavour
that has the ossaudio-lib installed. If you can't get it to compile on
some box that has ossaudio[-emulation], please notify me of this
problem so I can try to fix it.

Some HINTS FOR USAGE (no I don't make built-in help-functions for such a
tiny program):
-Pressing 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 does what you expect: Set the scrollbar to that
 position (indicated by the bar on top).
-The numeric keypad, with numlock OFF, can be used to set the volume. Arrows
 move both channels, home/PgUp/end/PgDn move left/right channel either up or
 down as you'd expect. This probably only makes sense on PC/AT-keyboard and
 lookalikes..haven't tested it on other architectures than x86.
-Sending cash to the dutch Postbank with account-no 6250177 with a reference
 to nmixer and your email-addy will give you good luck in the rest of your
 life, and will make me very happy too! I might even show you my gratitude
 in some unique way :)
